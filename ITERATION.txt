One of the most common pieces of feedback I got was that play testers had a hard time understanding what the objective was (whether is was to take the gold or defend it). This led to me creating the first few levels focused on guidance, with one in particular focusing on learning the objective of the game. 
Another big piece of feedback revolved around going down. A lot of people were unsure what the advantages and disadvantages were to going underwater, so I made another level that used guidance to teach players how to go down, at which point they would be forced to navigate through a small maze so they would realize they had much higher mobility underwater. One play tester recommended adding an object that could block mobility above the water, which led to me implementing the dock prefab (this was extremely helpful feedback). 
The last piece of major feedback was that people had a hard time seeing where they were underwater, which led to me adjusting the shadows and angling the camera to capture more of the surface when underwater.
